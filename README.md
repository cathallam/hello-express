# hello-express
Introduction to Express

# To complete this challenge, you will need to:


- Create a .gitignore file and add node_modules.
- Create a new package.json file in your project folder with npm init specifying jest as your test command.
- Install Jest as a developer dependency.

âš¡ Configure ESLint for project.
- Install Express.
- In your project root folder, create a new file called app.js.
- Inside, type in the Hello world example from the Express docs.
- Run node app.js.
- Make a GET request in Postman to http://localhost:3000. Inspect the response and headers.
- Make a GET request in the browser to http://localhost:3000. Inspect the response and headers.
- Modify your / route so the <response>.send method sends a JavaScript object instead of a string (e.g. { message: 'Hello World!' })
- Restart your Node process and make the GET request in Postman again. Inspect the response and headers to see what has changed.
